## 🎯 Getting Started

Follow these steps to create your own PIAIC card:

### 1. Run the Python Code on Google Colab
Open Google Colab.
Upload the piaic_card_generator.ipynb file into your Colab notebook.
Run all cells to generate your PIAIC card.

### 2. Edit Personal Details
Replace the placeholders in the code with your own details:

```
#Example
name = "WAJAHAT"
piaic_id = "PIAIC12345"
course = "Artificial Intelligence"
```

### 4. Customize the Design (Optional)
If you want to change the design of the card, you can modify the PIL functions in the code to adjust colors, fonts, and images:

```
# Example for changing background color
background_color = (255, 255, 255)  # White background
```

### 🧰 Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```
PIL for image processing
Numpy for numerical operations
Matplotlib for visualization
```
If you are using Google Colab, the libraries are pre-installed, and you can import them using:

```
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### ✨ Output Customization
Name: Add your name, PIAIC ID, and course title to the card.
Profile Picture: Upload your own photo to personalize the card.
Course Details: Change the course details to reflect your program of study.
